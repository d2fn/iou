This repository contains the source for my expense tracking site http://iou.d2fn.com

If you need something that tracks expenses of long-lived groups (such as housemates) this isn't the tool for you.  However, if you are sharing a dozen or so expenses with a group of people over a weekend for example, this calculator will track who owes how much to the others. An assumption is made that each person is equally responsible for each expense.  If certain expenses are shared by a subset or overlapping set of people, that will need to be calculated separately.

Enter an expense on each line--the person's name and the amount of the expense.  Multiple expenses for the same person is ok as long as the name matches.

Everything runs client side.  There is no server-side component. Results are calculated and displayed after each keystroke.
